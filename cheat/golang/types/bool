type bool bool

// true and false are the two untyped boolean values.
const (
    true  = 0 == 0 // Untyped bool.
    false = 0 != 0 // Untyped bool.
)

// The predeclared boolean type is bool; it is a defined type.
var b bool

// Zero value for bool is false.

// Size of bool as hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x is 1 byte
