// In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from the math package.
// `pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.
// When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(math.pi)
}

// Run the code. Notice the error message.
// To fix the error, rename math.pi to math.Pi and try it again.

// Exported identifiers
// An identifier may be exported to permit access to it from another package. An identifier is exported if both:
//     1. the first character of the identifier's name is a Unicode upper case letter (Unicode class "Lu"); and
//     2. the identifier is declared in the package block or it is a field name or method name.
// All other identifiers are not exported.
